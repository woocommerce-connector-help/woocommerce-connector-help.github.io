# Total shipping amount line

You can configure the WooCommerce Connector to automatically add a total shipping amount line on sales orders, and post the amount to a designated General Ledger (G/L) account. The WooCommerce Connector adds the line during the synchronization of orders between your webstore and Business Central.

Using this feature can provide valuable insights into your shipping costs.

To enable this feature, you must specify the G/L account number to which the WooCommerce Connector is to post shipping amounts from webstore orders. For more information, go to [Shipping account number](shipping-account-number.md).
