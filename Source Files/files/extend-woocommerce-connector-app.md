# Extend the WooCommerce Connector app

The WooCommerce Connector app is fully extensible with events that you can subscribe to and use to enhance the business logic for your custom processes. If you cannot find the proper publishers, contact the WooCommerce Connector app <a href="https://www.synfynal.com/contact" target="_blank">support</a> team. If desired, the support team can build the per tenant extension for you.
