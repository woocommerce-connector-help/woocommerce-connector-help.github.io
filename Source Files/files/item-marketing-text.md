# Item marketing text

Business Central provides the capability for you to use Microsoft's AI assistant Copilot to suggest item marketing text based on the information from within Business Central. Copilot is designed to save you time and help you write creative and engaging text that reflects your brand and is consistent across your product line. 

Copilot bases the suggested text on the following information:

- Attributes defined for the item, for example, the description, item category, color, dimensions, and material.
- Selectable style preferences like tone of voice, format, and length.

After you have created item marketing text, you can configure the WooCommerce Connector to push the <b>Marketing Text</b> from Business Central to WooCommerce to be used in the item's <b>Product Long Description</b> or <b>Product Short Description</b> in your WooCommerce store.
