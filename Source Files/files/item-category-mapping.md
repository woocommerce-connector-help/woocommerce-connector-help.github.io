# Item category mapping

The WooCommerce Connector app provides the capability for you to map the item categories that you want to synchronize between WooCommerce and Business Central. Item category mapping ensures that your products appear in your online store and are available for purchase, while keeping your inventory and sales channels synchronized for seamless operations and efficient management.

To assist with item category mapping, the WooCommerce Connector app includes the capability for you to map item categories between WooCommerce and Business Central based on their category names. For more information, go to [Suggest item category mapping](suggest-item-category-mapping.md).

After you have completed item category mapping, you can perform a synchronization. For more information about synchronizing item categories, go to [Synchronize item categories](synchronize-item-categories.md).
