# Order synchronization start date

The WooCommerce Connector provides the capability for you to specify the date on which you want the WooCommerce Connector to start synchronizing orders.

For example, if you have entered orders from WooCommerce into Business Central through December 31st, you can specify January 1st as the date on which you want the WooCommerce Connector to start synchronizing orders between Business Central and your WooCommerce store. 

If you leave the order synchronization start date blank, the WooCommerce Connector synchronizes all orders.

## To configure the order synchronization start date

1. Choose ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do"), enter <i>woocommerce connector setup</i>, and then choose the related link.

   The <b>WooCommerce Connector Setup</b> page opens.

1. In <b>Order Sync. Start Date</b>, specify the date on which you want the WooCommerce Connector to start synchronizing orders.
