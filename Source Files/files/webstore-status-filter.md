# Webstore status filter

The WooCommerce Connector provides the capability for you to filter order synchronization by status. You can specify the one or more statuses by which you want the WooCommerce Connector to filter orders.

If no filter is set, the WooCommerce Connector synchronizes all orders between Business Central and your WooCommerce store.

## To filter order synchronization by status

1. Choose ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do"), enter <i>woocommerce connector setup</i>, and then choose the related link.

   The <b>WooCommerce Connector Setup</b> page opens.

1. In <b>Webstore Status Filter</b>, specify the one or more statuses by which you want the WooCommerce Connector to filter orders.
