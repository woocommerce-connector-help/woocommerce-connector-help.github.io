# WooCommerce Connector app pricing

The WooCommerce Connector app is free to use in a sandbox environment and has a 15 day free trial period in a production environment. After the free trial period ends, you must buy a subscription and pay based on the number of sales orders that the WooCommerce Connector app synchronizes per month. You only pay for what you use.

For more information, go to <a href="https://www.synfynal.com/plans-pricing" target="_blank">Pricing</a>.

Also, if required, you can purchase additional modules for the WooCommerce Connector app. These additional paid feature modules require a one time payment. For more information, go to [Additional paid features](additional-paid-features.md).
