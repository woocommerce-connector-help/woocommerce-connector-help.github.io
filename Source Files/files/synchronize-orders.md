# Synchronize orders

The WooCommerce Connector app provides the capability for you to synchronize orders between WooCommerce and Business Central. Synchronizing ensures that your orders are up-to-date and consistent between both platforms. 

When you perform a synchronization, the WooCommerce Connector synchronizes orders based on the order synchronization setup on the <b>WooCommerce Connector Setup</b> page.

## To manually synchronize orders

1. Choose ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do"), enter <i>woocommerce connector setup</i>, and then choose the related link.

   The <b>WooCommerce Connector Setup</b> page opens.

1. On the action bar, choose <b>Synchronization</b> > <b>Synchronize</b>.
