# Production environment

After you are familiar with how the WooCommerce Connector app works and have successfully tested the app in your sandbox environment, you can then implement the app in your production environment.

You configure the app in your production environment using the same procedures as you used for your sandbox environment.

After you install the app in your production environment, you must buy a subscription for the app. For more information about buying a subscription, go to [Buy a subscription](buy-subscription.md).
