# Suggest item category mapping

To assist with item category mapping, the WooCommerce Connector app includes the capability for you to map item categories between WooCommerce and Business Central based on their names. For example, if you have an item category named <i>Clothing</i> in your webstore and Business Central, the WooCommerce Connector app automatically maps this item category. 

This feature eliminates the need for you to manually map all item categories, saving you time, and reducing the risk of errors.

When you use this feature, the WooCommerce Connector app automatically maps item category records with identical names in both WooCommerce and Business Central. This feature only works when there is an exact one-to-one match between the records. To avoid any synchronization errors, the WooCommerce Connector app does not map records if there are multiple items with the same name criteria.

## To have the WooCommerce Connector app suggest item mapping

1. Choose ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do"), enter <i>woocommerce connector setup</i>, and then choose the related link.

   The <b>WooCommerce Connector Setup</b> page opens.

1. On the action bar, choose <b>Webstore</b> > <b>Suggest Item Category Mapping</b>.
