# Synchronize item categories

After you have mapped the item categories that you want to synchronize between WooCommerce and Business Central, you can perform a synchronization. Synchronizing ensures that your item categories are up-to-date and consistent between both platforms. 

When you perform a synchronization, the WooCommerce Connector app synchronizes item categories based on the values that you have specified in <b>Push Webstore Item Categories</b> and <b>Pull Webstore Item Categories</b> during the WooCommerce Connector setup and the item category mapping setup.

## To synchronize item categories

1. Choose ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do"), enter <i>woocommerce connector setup</i>, and then choose the related link.

   The <b>WooCommerce Connector Setup</b> page opens.

1. On the action bar, choose <b>Synchronization</b> > <b>Synchronize</b>.
