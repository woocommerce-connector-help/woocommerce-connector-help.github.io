# Total tax amount line

You can configure the WooCommerce Connector to automatically add a total tax amount line on sales orders, and post the amount to a designated General Ledger (G/L) account. The WooCommerce Connector adds the line during the synchronization of orders between your webstore and Business Central.

Using this feature can provide valuable insights about tax costs.

To enable this feature, you must specify the G/L account to which the WooCommerce Connector is to post sales tax amounts from webstore orders. For more information, go to [Sales tax account number](sales-tax-account-number.md).
