# Customer specific pricing

The WooCommerce Connector provides the capability for you to synchronize item prices between Business Central and your webstore using the <b>ELEX WooCommerce Role Based Pricing</b> plugin.

> [!NOTE]
> <b>Note</b>:<br>The customer specific pricing feature is only available as a separately purchased per tenant extension. For more information, go to [Additional paid features](additional-paid-features.md).

The synchronization supports price and discount groups, as well as specific customer synchronization, enabling businesses to maintain consistent pricing strategies across platforms.
