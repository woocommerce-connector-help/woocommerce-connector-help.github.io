# Synchronize customers

The WooCommerce Connector app provides the capability for you to synchronize customers between WooCommerce and Business Central. Synchronizing ensures that your customers are up-to-date and consistent between both platforms. 

When you perform a synchronization, the WooCommerce Connector synchronizes customers based on the values that are specified in <b>Push Webstore Customers</b> and <b>Pull Webstore Customers</b> on the <b>WooCommerce Connector Setup</b> page and the customer mapping setup.

You can synchronize all customers or choose to synchronize only selected customers.
