# Set up an additional webstore

The process to set up an additional webstore is similar to the initial store set up. The only difference is that you must specify a unique <b>Code</b> for the additional store.

## To set up an additional webstore

1. Choose ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do"), enter <i>woocommerce connector setup</i>, and then choose the related link.

   The <b>WooCommerce Connector Setup</b> page opens.

1. On the action bar, choose <b>Connection</b> > <b>Add Store</b>.

   The <b>WooCommerce Connector Setup</b> wizard opens.

1. In <b>Code</b>, specify a unique code to represent the additional store.

1. Specify values for other fields in the same way as the initial webstore setup. For more information, go to [Set up the WooCommerce Connector](set-up-woocommerce-connector.md).
