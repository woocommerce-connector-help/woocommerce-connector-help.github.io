# Product variations as items

The WooCommerce Connector provides the capability for you to synchronize your product variations from your WooCommerce store to Business Central as regular items. 

> [!NOTE]
> <b>Note</b>:<br>The product variations as items feature is only available as a separately purchased per tenant extension. For more information, go to [Additional paid features](additional-paid-features.md).

When you use the product variations as items feature, the WooCommerce Connector completes the following tasks:

- Each of your WooCommerce store product records is synchronized with a Business Central regular item.
- Each of your WooCommerce store product variations is synchronized with a separate regular item.

## Webstore Variant ID

The product variations as items feature uses a <b>Webstore Variant ID</b> field that appears on the <b>Webstore Item Mapping</b> page. The <b>Webstore Variant ID</b> field specifies the ID of the product variation in your WooCommerce store. When this feature is enabled, the WooCommerce Connector automatically populates the <b>Webstore Variant ID</b> for each synchronized item.

## To set up product variations as items

1. Choose ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do"), enter <i>woocommerce connector setup</i>, and then choose the related link.

   The <b>WooCommerce Connector Setup</b> page opens.

1. On the <b>Posting</b> FastTab, in the <b>Inventory</b> section, turn on <b>Item Variations as Items</b>.

1. Perform a synchronization of webstore item mapping. 

   For more information, go to [Synchronize webstore item mapping](synchronize-webstore-item-mapping.md).
