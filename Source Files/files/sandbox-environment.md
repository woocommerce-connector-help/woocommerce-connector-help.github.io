# Sandbox environment

Typically, you install, and then set up the WooCommerce Connector in a sandbox environment. After you are familiar with how the app works and have successfully tested the app, you then implement the app in your production environment.

A subscription is not necessary to use the app in a sandbox environment. You only have to pay for the app when you use the app in your production environment.
