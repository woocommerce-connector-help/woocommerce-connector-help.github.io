# Shipping account number

The WooCommerce Connector provides the capability for you to specify the General Ledger (G/L) account to which the WooCommerce Connector is to post shipping amounts from webstore orders.

When a shipping G/L account is specified, the WooCommerce Connector adds separate order lines during synchronization and the lines are posted on designated accounts.

## To configure the shipping account number

1. Choose ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do"), enter <i>woocommerce connector setup</i>, and then choose the related link.

   The <b>WooCommerce Connector Setup</b> page opens.

1. In <b>Shipping Account No.</b>, specify the number that represents the G/L account to which the WooCommerce Connector is to post shipping amounts from webstore orders.
