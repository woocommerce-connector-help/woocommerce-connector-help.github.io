# Synchronization logs

To help you monitor, troubleshoot, and validate the data exchange between Business Central and your WooCommerce store, the WooCommerce Connector keeps detailed logs that track the process of synchronizing data. The WooCommerce Connector keeps separate logs per WooCommerce store.

The logs provide insights into synchronization records, including errors, and reports.

The latest synchronization cues displays the date and time that the last synchronization job ran or experienced errors for each record type.

You can configure the length of time that the Woocommerce Connector is to retain activity log records.

## To view the synchronization logs

1. On the <b>Business Manager</b> or <b>Sales Order Processor</b> role centers, in the menu choose <b>WooCommerce</b> > <b>Webstores</b>.

   The <b>Webstores</b> page opens.

1. In the FactBox page, under <b>Synchronization Logs</b>, select the cue for which you want to view the respective synchronization log.

## To set the activity log retention period

1. Choose ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do"), enter <i>woocommerce connector setup</i>, and then choose the related link.
