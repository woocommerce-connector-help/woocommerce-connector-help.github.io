# Set up an additional WooCommerce store

The process to set up an additional WooCommerce store is similar to the initial store set up. The only difference is that you must specify a unique <b>Code</b> for the additional store.

## To set up an additional WooCommerce store

1. Choose ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do"), enter <i>woocommerce connector setup</i>, and then choose the related link.

   The <b>WooCommerce Connector Setup</b> page opens.

1. On the action bar, choose <b>Connection</b> > <b>Add Store</b>.

   The <b>WooCommerce Connector Setup</b> wizard opens.

1. In <b>Code</b>, specify a unique code to represent the additional store.

1. Specify values for other fields in the same way as the initial WooCommerce store setup. For more information, go to [Set up the WooCommerce Connector](set-up-woocommerce-connector.md).
