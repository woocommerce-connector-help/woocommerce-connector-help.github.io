# Welcome to the WooCommerce Connector Help

The WooCommerce Connector seamlessly integrates a WooCommerce webstore with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. This integration combines the strengths of both platforms. WooCommerce is an open-source e-commerce solution that fuels over four million online stores, while Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central is a cloud-based ERP that is trusted by more than 40,000 small and midsize businesses. With WooCommerce, you can create an online store to sell your products, and with Business Central, you can effectively manage your finances, sales, services, and operations. 

On this help site, you can explore in-depth articles about the WooCommerce Connector. You will learn how to set up the connector to synchronizes orders, items, item categories, item variants, item attributes, inventory, customers, coupons, and more across both applications.
