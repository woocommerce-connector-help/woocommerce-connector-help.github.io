# Default location code

The WooCommerce Connector provides the capability for you to configure the default location that you want the WooCommerce Connector to use to determine the available inventory. The WooCommerce Connector also assigns this location code on incoming sales orders.

## To configure the default item template

1. Choose ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do"), enter <i>woocommerce connector setup</i>, and then choose the related link.

   The <b>WooCommerce Connector Setup</b> page opens.

1. In <b>Default Location Code</b>, specify the location code that you want the WooCommerce Connector to use to determine the available inventory and to assign on incoming sales orders.
