    "keywords": "API consumer key and consumer secret For API communication between Business Central and your WooCommerce store, the WooCommerce Connector uses a consumer key and consumer secret. The WooCommerce Connector uses the consumer key and secret for authentication and access control purposes. Generate an API consumer key and secret For information about how to generate an API consumer key and secret, go to WooCommerce REST API. The WooCommerce Connector supports saving the entire consumer key that is generated from WooCommerce. Although the full key is saved, the WooCommerce Connector masks and displays only the first 10 characters. To configure the consumer key and secret in the WooCommerce Connector Choose , enter woocommerce connector setup, and then choose the related link. The WooCommerce Connector Setup page opens. In Consumer Key, specify the consumer key that you generated in WooCommerce. In Consumer Secret, specify the consumer key that you generated in WooCommerce. Passing consumer key and secret through the authorization header or as query string parameters Typically, the WooCommerce Connector passes the consumer key and secret through the authorization header in the HTTP request. However, there may be cases where servers have issues parsing the authorization header correctly. To prevent these parsing issues, the WooCommerce Connector provides the capability for you to specify that the consumer key and secret be passed as query string parameters, instead of through the authorization header. Important Important: Passing the consumer key and secret as query string parameters is less secure than passing the consumer key and secret using the authorization header. It is recommended that you only pass the consumer key and secret as query string parameters when this method of authentication is absolutely necessary. To configure the WooCommerce Connector to pass the consumer key and secret as query string parameters Choose , enter woocommerce connector setup, and then choose the related link.

You must specify the customer price group for which you want the WooCommerce Connector to push the Unit Price on the Customer Price Group page in Business Central to the Item Regular Price in your WooCommerce store. Sales price The sales price that is used for your WooCommerce store is not linked to any customer group code in Business Central. This design is because WooCommerce only supports one price for all customers, and does not facilitate customer-specific prices by default. Therefore, the price that's defined for all customers is used as the default sales price. The sales price is calculated as the best sales price from the sales price list for all customers that's relevant for the current date. Set regular and sales prices during item configuration When you perform item mapping, the WooCommerce Connector displays a Webstore Item - Details FactBox. In the FactBox there are Regular Price and Sale Price fields. If there is a value present, the WooCommerce Connector pushes this value to your WooCommerce store during an item synchronization. Alternatively, if there is no value, you can select the Create New link, and then specify a price. When you select the Create New link and Customer Price Group is specified for Regular Price on the WooCommerce Connector Setup page, the WooCommerce Connector opens the Sales Prices page.
